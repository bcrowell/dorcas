class Match
  # Describes a plan of attack for OCRing text. Includes thresholds, a list of characters to be matched, and
  # options such as forcing a character to be matched near a certain location on the page.
  # Forcing location is not yet implemented.
  # Meta_threshold is meant to go from 0 to 1. See tuning.rb for details.
  # Simplest use is through m=Match.new(), hits=m.execute().
  # Instead of m.execute, can also do m.three_stage_prep, m.three_stage_finish, ..., m.three_stage_cleanup, which
  # allows the fft stage to be parallelized while the characters are processed one at a time in m.three_stage_finish.

  # an Îµ in the seed font can match Î± in the text. Masking gets rid of the two "twigs" on the right side of the alpha
  # and makes it look like an omicron. (2) Can erase part of a correctly matched letter. This happened with Ï from p. 10 of Giles.
