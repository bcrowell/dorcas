=Notes on order of array indices=
My normal convention in my ruby code is (x,y).

The python code for convolution uses PIL and Numpy.
PIL uses (x,y). Numpy uses (y,x). The routines that convert back and forth between
PIL and Numpy silently transpose by default.

In my chapel code (which I will probably get rid of), I use
(y,x) so that a document can be sliced horizontally into
smaller jobs.
